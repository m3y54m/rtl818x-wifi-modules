# RTL8188 & RTL8189 Wi-Fi Modules

RTL8188 and RTL8189 are both Wi-Fi modules mostly used in embedded Linux systems. In this repository I collected all resources and information required to design hardware and develop applications using any of these two modules.

The main difference between RTL8188EUS and RTL8189ETV is in their interfaces. RTL8188EUS can be interfaced only using **USB** while RTL8189ETV can be interfaced using **SDIO**.

## RTL8188

**RTL8188** module is based on the RTL8188CUS or RTL8188EUS chipset which is commonly used in cheap USB to Wi-Fi dongles which have similar drivers and software development procedure.

The RTL8188 module has a different shape which you can use it in your customized hardware designs. There are different variations of this module which mostly have almost the same footprints and sizes.

## RTL8189

As it is metioned before **RTL8189** module is based on RTL8189ETV chipset which provides SDIO as its main interface for connecting to the MCU/MPU of your system. Just like RTL8188 there are different variations of RTL8189 module which mostly have almost the same footprints and sizes.
